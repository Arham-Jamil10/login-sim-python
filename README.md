# Python Login System

This is a simple login system I created while learning core Python concepts. The idea was to practice how 'while loop', 'break', 'continue', and 'pass' work in real scenarios, so I built this small script to handle user login attempts.

It checks for empty inputs, suspended users, and incorrect credentials and allows a limited number of tries. It might not be production-ready, but it helped me get more comfortable with control flow and dictionaries.

### What it does:
- Checks username and password against a stored dictionary
- Skips empty inputs
- Ignores (but records) suspended users using `pass`
- Limits login attempts and locks out after 3 failures

Iâ€™ve kept the logic straightforward so that others learning Python can follow along easily.

Feel free to try it out or suggest ways to improve it.
